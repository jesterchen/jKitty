# jKitty
This is an attempt to create an electronic register for Coffee Corners (or however they might been called). If everything works out, jKitty will provide a web interface with the following features:
- Admin Interface with the ability to create and remove users
- User Interface for persons managing the kitties
- Consumer Interface to view own consumption
- E-mail ability (or even implementing the jMessageLib, which will somewhen use various notifications)

## Technical stuff
The following things are used:
- python-flask
- bootstrap4
- json-file or sqlite for storage of data
- scrypt from hashlib for password storage
- Dockerfile for smooth deployment

## Uhm... Stuff
This is a project I di in my spare time. Do not expect anything. Merge requests are welcome.
